      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      
      <p>
        The Community Book Exchange platform was created to foster a simple, sustainable way for book lovers to share their stories and discover new ones. We believe every book deserves a new reader and every reader deserves a new adventure without the cost.
      </p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>**List Your Books:** Easily add the books you are ready to part with using the "Add Book" form.</li>
        <li>**Browse & Request:** Look through books listed by other members of your community.</li>
        <li>**Exchange:** Arrange a meeting or mailing swap with the other member to exchange your books.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Meet the Creator</h3>
      <p>
        This project was created by Shabnam as a passion project to connect local book communities. We are committed to making reading accessible and promoting sustainable consumption.
